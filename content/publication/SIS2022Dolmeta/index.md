abstract: The use of statistical methods in sport analytics is common practice nowadays. In this work, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model for describing and predicting the evolution of performance over time for shot put athletes. We address seasonality and heterogeneity in results by means of a linear mixed effects model with heteroskedastic errors. The model provides an accurate description of the performance trajectories and allows for prediction of athletesâ€™ performance in future seasons. We apply our method to an extensive real world data set on performance data of professional shot put athletes recorded at elite competitions.
