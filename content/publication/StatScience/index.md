abstract: Neuroimaging meta-analysis is an area of growing interest in
statistics. The special characteristics of neuroimaging data render classical
meta-analysis methods inapplicable and therefore new methods have been
developed. We review existing methodologies, explaining the benefits and
drawbacks of each. A demonstration on a real dataset of emotion studies is
included. We discuss some still-open problems in the field to highlight the
need for future research.
