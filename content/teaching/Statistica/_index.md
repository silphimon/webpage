## Bachelor's degree programme

I teach this course for the Laurea Triennale (BSc) programme in [International Economics and Marketing (CLEMI)](https://www.economia.unimore.it/en/education/bachelors-degree-programmes/international-economics-and-marketing) at Unimore. The course is taught in Italian.

## Program overview

The course introduces students to concepts in descriptive statistics, probability, statistical inference, and linear regression. These concepts constitute basic knowledge to develop applied quantitative analyses, and are useful to carry out a rigorous close examination of social and economic phenomena.


## What you will learn

- Descriptive statistics (e.g., data collection, data matrix, synthesis of the distribution of one/two variable(s), relationship between two variables, etc.)
- Basic laws of probability, random events, independence, expectations
- Discrete (Uniform, Bernoulli and Binomial) and continuous (Gaussian, $t$) random variables, probability density and mass functions and distribution functions
- Statistical inference (sampling theory, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing)
- The simple linear regression model

## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
Students are encouraged to take General and Financial Mathematics (CLEMI BSc program) prior to this course. Students must have some background in differential and integral calculus. Specifically, you should be able to take derivatives and integrals of standard functions (exponential, polynomials, logarithms). You should also understand the basic applications of calculus (finding areas under curves, maximizing/minimizing functions, etc.).
