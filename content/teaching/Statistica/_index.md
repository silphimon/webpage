## Bachelor's Degree Programme

I teach this course for the Laurea Triennale (BSc) in [International Economics and Marketing (CLEMI)](https://www.economia.unimore.it/en/education/bachelors-degree-programmes/international-economics-and-marketing) at Unimore. The course is taught in Italian.

The course introduces students to concepts in descriptive statistics, probability, statistical inference, and linear regression. These concepts constitute basic knowledge to develop applied quantitative analyses, and are useful to carry out a rigorous close examination of social and economic phenomena.
