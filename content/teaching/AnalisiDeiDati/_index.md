## Master's degree programme

I (co-)teach this course for the Laurea Magistrale (MSc) programme in [Data Analysis for Economics and Management (ADEM)](https://www.economia.unimore.it/en/education/master-degree-courses/data-analysis-economics-and-management) at Unimore. The course is taught in Italian.


## Program overview

I teach the first (21-hours) module for this course. The first module consists in a review of basic topics in probability and statistical inference.

The course then continues with a 21-hours module on linear and non-linear regression taught by [Prof. Barbara Pistoresi](https://personale.unimore.it/Rubrica/dettaglio/pistores), and ends with a 21-hours module on regression with instrumental variables/panel data/time series taught by [Prof. Mario Forni](https://personale.unimore.it/Rubrica/dettaglio/forni). 


## What you will learn (module I)

- Introduction to statistics and data analysis; discrete and continuous probability distributions; sampling distributions
- Point and interval estimation for the mean of a (Gaussian) population and for the difference in means of two (Gaussian) populations
- Hypothesis testing for the mean of a (Gaussian) population and for the difference in means of two (Gaussian) populations

## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
The course builds on knowledge of basic statistics concepts at a Bachelor's degree level. However, the first module (which I teach) reintroduces these basic stats concepts. Therefore, attending the first module may be particularly beneficial for students coming from three-year degree programs where the statistics course is not compulsory.
