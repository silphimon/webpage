## Master's degree programme

I (co-)teach this course for the Laurea Magistrale (MSc) programme in [Data Analysis for Economics and Management (ADEM)](https://www.economia.unimore.it/en/education/master-degree-courses/data-analysis-economics-and-management) at Unimore. The course is taught in Italian.


## Program overview

The course introduces several data analysis techniques in the context of specific scenarios of economic analysis and business management. It consists of several modules. 

I teach the first (21-hours) module for this course. The module consists in a review of basic topics in probability and statistical inference.

The second and third modules deal with the construction of econometric models for the analysis of relationships between variables. They introduce students to the study of the effectiveness of a policy intervention by analysing the causal effects of one or more variables on a phenomenon of interest, together with the problem of their identification and estimation.

The second (21-hours) module is taught by [Prof. Barbara Pistoresi](https://personale.unimore.it/Rubrica/dettaglio/pistores), and the third (21-hours) module is taught by [Prof. Mario Forni](https://personale.unimore.it/Rubrica/dettaglio/forni). 


## What you will learn (module I)

- Introduction to statistics and data analysis; discrete and continuous probability distributions; sampling distributions
- Point and interval estimation for the mean of a (Gaussian) population and for the difference in means of two (Gaussian) populations
- Hypothesis testing for the mean of a (Gaussian) population and for the difference in means of two (Gaussian) populations

## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
The course builds on knowledge of basic statistics concepts at a Bachelor's degree level. However, the first module (which I teach) reintroduces these basic stats concepts. Therefore, attending the first module may be particularly beneficial for students coming from three-year degree programs where the statistics course is not compulsory.
