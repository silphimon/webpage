I am Assistant Professor in Statistics at the Dipartimento di Scienze Economico-sociali e Matematico-statistiche (ESOMAS) at the Università degli Studi di Torino, IT. Prior to joining Torino, I was lecturer in Statistics at the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Kent, UK (2017), and post-doctoral research fellow in Statistics at the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick, UK (2014-2017). I obtained a PhD in Statistical Science at Duke University (USA) in November 2013.

My research focuses primarily on the development of Bayesian models for the analysis of functional and longitudinal data. In particular, I am interested in methods to extract the low-dimensional structure in the data (latent factors, principal components, clustering), and flexible parametric and non-parametric modelling (bases expansions, Gaussian/spatial processes). Some highlight application areas are neuroimaging, sport analytics, -omics data, and causal inference.
