I am Assistant Professor in Statistics (RTD-B) at the [Dipartimento di Economia Marco Biagi](https://www.economia.unimore.it/it), Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia (Unimore). Prior to joining Unimore, I was Assistant Professor in Statistics at [Università degli Studi di Torino](https://www.unito.it/) (2018-2023), lecturer in Statistics in the [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science) (2017), and post-doctoral research fellow in Statistics at the [Department of Statistics, University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/) (2014-2016). I obtained a PhD in Statistical Science from [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/) in November 2013.

My research focuses primarily on the development of Bayesian models for the analysis of functional and longitudinal data. In particular, I am interested in methods to extract the low-dimensional structure in the data (latent factors, principal components, clustering), and flexible parametric and non-parametric modelling (bases expansions, Gaussian/spatial processes). Some highlight application areas are neuroimaging, sport analytics, -omics data, and causal inference.
